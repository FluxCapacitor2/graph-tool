# About

This website was created to make it easier to create professional-looking plots of functions and data.

It's powered by a plotting library called [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), and it runs in the browser using [`gnuplot-wasm`](https://github.com/Eumeryx/gnuplot-wasm).

The website is made with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and utilizes the following modules and plugins:

- TailwindCSS with the Tailwind Typography plugin
- Nuxt UI
- Nuxt Content
- Pinia
